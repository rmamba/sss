Sigal is yet another simple static gallery generator. It's written in Python
and it allows to build a static gallery of images with the following features:

* Process directories recursively.
* Generate HTML pages using jinja2 templates.
* Relative links for a portable output.
* Support themes, videos, EXIF tags, zip download.
* Parallel processing.
* MIT licensed.

The idea behind Sigal is to ease the use of the javascript libraries like
galleria_. These libraries do a great job to display the images, Sigal does
what is missing: resize images, create thumbnails, generate HTML pages.

SSS is compatible with Python 2.7 and 3.3+.
